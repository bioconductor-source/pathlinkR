\usage{
pathwayEnrichment(
  inputList,
  columnFC = NA,
  columnP = NA,
  filterInput = TRUE,
  pCutoff = 0.05,
  fcCutoff = 1.5,
  split = TRUE,
  analysis = "sigora",
  filterResults = "default",
  gpsRepo = "default",
  geneUniverse = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputList}{A list, with each element containing RNA-Seq results as a
"DESeqResults", "TopTags", or "data.frame" object. Rownames of each table
must contain Ensembl Gene IDs. The list names are used as the comparison
name for each element (e.g. "COVID vs Healthy"). See Details for more
information on supported input types.}

\item{columnFC}{Character; Column to plot along the x-axis, typically log2
fold change values. Only required when \code{rnaseqResult} is a simple data
frame. Defaults to NA.}

\item{columnP}{Character; Column to plot along the y-axis, typically nominal
or adjusted p values. Only required when \code{rnaseqResult} is a simple data
frame. Defaults to NA.}

\item{filterInput}{When providing list of data frames containing the
unfiltered RNA-Seq results (i.e. not all genes are significant), set this
to \code{TRUE} to remove non-significant genes using the thresholds set by the
\code{pCutoff} and \code{fcCutoff}. When this argument is \code{FALSE}
its assumed your passing a pre-filtered data in \code{inputList}, and no
more filtering will be done.}

\item{pCutoff}{Adjusted p value cutoff when filtering. Defaults to < 0.05.}

\item{fcCutoff}{Minimum absolute fold change value when filtering. Defaults
to > 1.5}

\item{split}{Boolean (TRUE); Split into up- and down-regulated DE genes using
the fold change column, and do enrichment independently on each. Results
are combined at the end, with an added "direction" column.}

\item{analysis}{Method/database to use for enrichment analysis. The default
is "sigora", but can also be "reactomepa" or "hallmark"}

\item{filterResults}{Should the output be filtered for significance?
Use \code{1} to return the unfiltered results, or any number less than 1
for a custom p-value cutoff. If left as \code{default}, the significance cutoff
for Sigora is 0.001, or 0.05 for ReactomePA and Hallmark.}

\item{gpsRepo}{Only applies to \code{analysis="sigora"}. Gene Pair Signature
object for Sigora to use to test for enriched pathways. Leaving this set
as "default" will use the "reaH" GPS object from \code{Sigora}, or you can
provide your own custom GPS repository.}

\item{geneUniverse}{Only applies when \code{analysis} is "reactomepa" or
"hallmark". The set of background genes to use when testing with ReactomePA
or Hallmark gene sets. For ReactomePA this must be a character vector of
Entrez genes. For Hallmark, it must be Ensembl IDs.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; If FALSE (the default), don't print info/progress
messages.}
}
\value{
A "data.frame" (tibble) of pathway enrichment results for all input
comparisons, with the following columns:
\item{comparison}{Source comparison from the names of \code{inputList}}
\item{direction}{Whether the pathway was enriched in all genes
(\code{split=FALSE}), or up- or down-regulated genes (\code{split=TRUE})}
\item{pathwayId}{Pathway identifier}
\item{pathwayName}{Pathway name}
\item{pValue}{Nominal p value for the pathway}
\item{pValueAdjusted}{p value, corrected for multiple testing}
\item{genes}{Candidate genes, which were DE for the comparison and also in
the pathway}
\item{numCandidateGenes}{Number of candidate genes}
\item{numBgGenes}{Number of background genes for the pathway}
\item{geneRatio}{Ratio of candidate and background genes}
\item{totalGenes}{Number of DE genes which were tested for enriched
pathways}
\item{topLevelPathway}{High level Reactome term which serves to group
similar pathways}
}
\description{
This function provides a simple and consistent interface to
three different pathway enrichment tools: Sigora and ReactomePA (which both
test for Reactome pathways), and MSigDB Hallmark gene set enrichment.
}
\details{
\code{inputList} must be a named list of RNA-Seq results, with each
element being of class "DESeqResults" from \code{DESeq2}, "TopTags" from
\code{edgeR}, or a simple data frame. For the first two cases, column names are
expected to be the standard defined by each class ("log2FoldChange" and
"padj" for "DESeqResults", and "logFC" and "FDR" for "TopTags"). Hence for
these two cases the arguments \code{columnFC} and \code{columnP}
can be left as \code{NA}.

In the last case (elements are "data.frame"), both \code{columnFC} and
\code{columnP} must be supplied when \code{filterInput=TRUE},
and \code{columnFC} must be given if \code{split=TRUE}.
